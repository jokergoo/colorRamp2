Generate random colors

\usage{
rand_color(n, hue = NULL, luminosity = "random", transparency = 0, friendly = FALSE)
}
\arguments{

  \item{n}{Number of colors}
  \item{hue}{The hue of the generated color. You can use following default color name: \code{red}, \code{orange},  \code{yellow}, \code{green}, \code{blue}, \code{purple}, \code{pink} and \code{monochrome}. If the value is a hexidecimal color string such as \code{#00FFFF},  the function will extract its hue value and use that to generate colors.}
  \item{luminosity}{it controls the luminosity of the generated color. The value should be a string containing \code{bright}, \code{light}, \code{dark} and \code{random}.}
  \item{transparency}{Transparency, numeric value between 0 and 1.}
  \item{friendly}{If it is true, light random colors will not be generated.}
